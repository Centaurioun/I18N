00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,980
Thanks to SquareSpace for making this
video possible and for helping launch my

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,460
new Mustard store. More on that after
this video. In the midst of the Cold War,

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,039
two Mig-25s race to intercept a threat
along the Soviet border. They're the

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,810
fastest interceptors ever built, and if
they really push their engines, they can

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,260
reach an incredible Mach 3.2. But it's
not enough. Because what they're chasing

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,079
can outrun and out-climb any threat. A
plane engineered to be invulnerable.

7
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,769
The Cold War locked the United States
and Soviet Union into a tense a struggle

8
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:58,690
for global influence and control. Both
sides poured enormous resources into

9
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,670
military technologies. But getting an
upper hand means knowing your opponent's

10
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,500
next move. And in the 1950s, little was
known about facilities deep within the

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,030
Soviet Union. An extensive network of
radar stations, surface-to-air missile

12
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:20,560
sites, and interceptor air bases kept the
Americans away. Until 1956, when U-2

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,530
spy planes began flying over the Soviet
Union. Neither fast nor stealthy, the U-2s had

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,350
one critical advantage. At 70,000 feet,
they could fly above Soviet air defenses.

15
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,419
U.S. President Eisenhower was even
assured, Soviet radars couldn't detect

16
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,670
the U-2 at such high altitudes. But it
turns out, the Americans were wrong. The

17
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,470
Soviets had tracked the U-2 since day one, and it was only a matter of time before

18
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:53,050
they'd be able to shoot one down. Simply
flying high wasn't enough. Even before

19
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,950
the U-2 began its surveillance missions,
there were already plans underway to

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,720
replace it. Because true impunity over
Soviet airspace would need a combination

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,269
of incredible speed, altitude, and stealth.
And this led the Americans to explore

22
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:12,340
some pretty radical spy plane concepts,
like a ramjet powered aircraft that

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,250
would be deployed from the bottom of a
supersonic B-58. But in 1959 the CIA

24
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,819
chose Lockheed to develop the next
generation of spy plane.

25
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:26,950
Meanwhile, the U-2 continued to fly over
the Soviet Union. But not for very long,

26
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,899
because in the spring of 1960, a Soviet
surface-to-air missile finally managed

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,340
to bring one down. The captured pilot and
wreckage were paraded around the Soviet

28
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,290
Union used as proof of Western
aggression. As tensions rose, now more

29
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,109
than ever the US needed a replacement
for the U-2.

30
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:55,710
And what Lockheed developed, would be
unlike any aircraft ever built. A plane

31
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,660
that nearly 60 years after its first
flight, remains the fastest air-breathing

32
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,340
jet to ever fly. Lockheed's
highly-classified spy plane would be

33
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,190
known as the A-12. Originally used by the
CIA for reconnaissance, the A-12 was also

34
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,840
developed into an interceptor prototype,
armed with air-to-air missiles, along

35
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,890
with a variant that could launch an
unmanned reconnaissance drone. But it was

36
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,839
the SR-71 Blackbird, a variant developed
for the Air Force that would go on to

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,720
serve for decades, while earlier versions
were quickly retired. The Blackbird could

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,500
cruise at Mach 3.2 right near the edge
of space, and do it for hours on end.

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,030
To achieve this, Lockheed's engineers had
to innovate pretty much everything from

40
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,760
scratch. To sustain such incredible
speeds the SR-71 and its predecessors

41
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,190
were powered by engines often described
as turboramjets. Below Mach 2 they

42
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,970
functioned like conventional
after-burning jet engines. But above that,

43
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,190
they behaved more like ramjets, as an
inlet cone adjusted to bypass air around

44
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,730
the engine and directly into the
afterburner. At mach 3.2 the SR-71's

45
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:14,130
exterior would heat up to beyond 500
degrees Fahrenheit, easily hot enough to

46
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,529
soften aircraft aluminum. Lockheed
engineers used titanium for 92 percent

47
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,479
of the aircraft, and in the 1960s this
required inventing entirely new

48
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,150
fabrication technologies. It's unusual
shape did more than just spook UFO

49
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,400
enthusiasts, it helped reduce its radar
signature as did its special black paint,

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:43,000
which earned the SR-71 its Blackbird
name.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,980
The A-12 and SR-71 were first deployed
over North Korea and Vietnam, where they

52
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,290
were unsuccessfully targeted by over 800
surface-to-air missiles. But the spy

53
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,420
plane never flew into Soviet airspace. At
least not officially, because another

54
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,810
shoot-down over the Soviet Union would
be catastrophic.

55
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,150
So instead, the SR-71 flew along its
borders, using its powerful side-looking

56
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,450
radar and cameras to peer hundreds of
miles into Soviet territory. And that

57
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:20,960
frustrated the Soviets. In 1976, Viktor
Belenko defected to the west, by escaping

58
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,120
the Soviet Union in his Mig-25. He
described the frustration of trying to

59
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,100
intercept Blackbirds. The MiG's were
Mach 3 capable, but only for a few

60
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,660
minutes at a time. Not for hours like the
Blackbird. Nor could they climb to reach

61
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,330
the SR-71's incredible altitude. Even
their enormous R40 missiles lacked the

62
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,340
guidance needed to strike the SR-71
head-on. For years, the Blackbirds were

63
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,919
practically invulnerable. They could out
fly and out-climb any threat. But by the

64
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,960
1980s, Mig-31s were roaming the
skies, equipped with sophisticated radar

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,180
and long-range R33 missiles. They posed
a legitimate threat, as did a new

66
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,380
generation of Soviet surface-to-air
missiles. But the greatest threat to the

67
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,650
Blackbird wasn't an enemy missile or jet.
It was itself. No Blackbird was ever lost

68
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,359
on a mission, but more than a third of
the 50 built were destroyed in accidents.

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,060
One literally disintegrated around its
pilots. They were also enormously

70
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,340
expensive to operate. Each one siphoning
about 300 million dollars a year out of

71
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,409
America's defense budget. A fleet of
special aerial refuelers and a small army

72
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,430
of support and maintenance staff were
needed just to keep these planes mission

73
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,970
ready. And advances in spy satellites
aerial drones and the SR-71 s inability

74
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,110
to deliver surveillance data in real
time, diminished some of the plane's

75
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,150
utility. Add to that, politics and
infighting for defense budgets and by

76
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,250
the late 1980s, the SR-71's days were numbered.

77
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:04,139
They were officially retired in 1998,
with two sent to NASA for testing. The

78
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,710
technology behind the A-12 and SR-71 is
now well over fifty years old. Yet

79
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,049
somehow these incredible planes
still speak to us. Not about the past, but

80
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,570
the future. Leaving us with a sense of
wonder unlike any other in aviation

81
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:28,139
