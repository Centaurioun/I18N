#. DO NOT write code like this!
#. f-string is basically just a syntax sugar that makes compisite string more readable but f-string cannot be localized because
#. they don't provide a single string that can be stored as a resource item. Do not use!
#. name: Name of the person
#. age: Age of the person

#. This is the preferred way to localize composite strings.

#. DO NOT write code like this!
#. It is hard for translators to chnage the order of the placheolder
#. 1st {}: Name of the person
#. 2nd {}: Age of the person

#. Either add indexes to the placehoders or use named paramters.
#. This allows to reorder parameters in the localized patterns.
#. 0: Name of the person
#. 1: Age of the person

#. You can also use the old format syntax that uses %
#. %s: Name of the person
#: Composite.py:51
#, python-format
msgid "My name is %s"

#. However if you have more than do not use the old syntax: the parameter order cannot be changed
#. %s: Name of the person
#. %d: Age of the person
